# GARCH

The estGARCH function estimates the parameters of a GARCH(1,1) model for time series volatility modeling, commonly used in finance to capture time-varying variance in returns. The model assumes returns (R) are mean-zero and driven by shocks scaled by volatility, where the conditional variance at time t (V_t) depends on a constant (a), the previous period's variance (b * V_{t-1}), and the squared innovation (c * V_{t-1} * Z_{t-1}^2). The function takes an initial guess of parameters (pars0) and uses numerical optimization (fminsearch) to find the parameter values that maximize the log-likelihood function based on the observed return data. Internally, it iteratively constructs the time series of variances (V) and computes the log-likelihood assuming normally distributed returns. The function returns the estimated conditional variances (V), the optimal GARCH parameters (optpars), and the optimized log-likelihood value (optllf). Conceptually, this process fits a model where today's volatility depends on yesterday's volatility and return shocks, allowing the model to capture clustering and persistence in financial market volatility.
